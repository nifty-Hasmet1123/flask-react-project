1. finish up post render method
2. create component for both put and delete method

blocker:
how to actually return pk from front-end back to flask

how about creating a delete button from the render page
then only call the api put method if the delete button is clicked.

ideas:
    maybe put a useState on the getMethod renderer to store the 
    id numbers in a state. Then passed it in the put renderer.
